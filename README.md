###Introduction

Magical Arena allows players to create characters with attributes such as health, strength, and attack. Players engage in battles where dice rolls determine the outcome of attacks and defenses. The goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero to win the game.

###Overview

In the Magical Arena, each player is characterized by three attributes:

+ Health: The vitality of the player. If health reaches 0, the player is defeated.
+ Strength: Determines how effectively a player can defend against incoming attacks.
+ Attack: Defines the potency of a player's offensive capabilities.
